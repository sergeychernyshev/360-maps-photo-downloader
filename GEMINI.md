## Gemini Added Memories

- Always start servers in the background.
- When the user says 'new feature' followed by a name, I will create a new Git branch with that name. I will use hyphens to separate words in the branch name.
- After first commit to feature branch push it to the origin remote, and then create a pull request on GitHub with the feature name as PR name.
- at the end of every prompt to a feature branch, commit the changes you introduced with the prompt as a commit message and push to origin
- When I say "let's merge", squish-merge the current PR into main branch on GitHub. Then locally switch to main branch and pull the latest version. Restart the server after that.
