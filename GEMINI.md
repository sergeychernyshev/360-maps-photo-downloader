## Gemini Added Memories

- Always start servers in the background.
- When the user says 'new feature' followed by a name, I will create a new Git branch with that name. I will use hyphens to separate words in the branch name.
- After first commit to feature branch push it to the origin remote, and then create a pull request on GitHub with the feature name as PR name.
- at the end of every prompt to a feature branch, commit the changes you introduced and push to origin
